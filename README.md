# Predictive-Modelling-for-Soil-Crop-Compatibility-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Agriculture serves as the backbone of maintaining economies, and maximizing the choice of 
crop depending on soil and climate can enhance yield and profitability remarkably. This 
project, "Predictive Modeling for Soil-Crop Compatibility Using ML Algorithms," utilizes 
machine learning models to help farmers choose the best crop for their land. The model is 
created using primary soil and climate parameters like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), 
Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, Soil pH, and Rainfall.  
Different machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier, K
Nearest Neighbors, Bagging, and Stacking, were experimented upon to find the best accuracy 
for prediction. Among them, Random Forest Classifier gave the maximum accuracy of 99.09%, 
which is to be deployed as the final model. The system gives data-driven suggestions to the 
farmers that can help them gain maximum yield, maximize profit, and minimize crop failure 
risks. This study demonstrates the efficiency of machine learning in precision agriculture and 
encourages sustainable agriculture by making decisions based on data.
